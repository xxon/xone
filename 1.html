<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target=> HTML is the World Wide Webâ€™s
core markup language</a>. Originally, <strong>HTML was primarily designed as a language
for semantically</strong> describing scientific documents. Its general
design, however, has enabled it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to
describe a number of other types of documents and even <u>applications.</u>

HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive
forms, may be embeded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create
structured documents by denoting strutural semantics for text as headings,
paragraghs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elemets are delineated
by tags, written using angle brackets.
